      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      content="The Power of ProductHunt search without all the dead links. Have you ever searched something on ProductHunt and faced difficulty while searching through all the dead products? Introducing CleanHunt, a product which uses the existing ProductHunt API and discards those products from the results which don't have a live landing page. While not a perfect method, all startups which are no longer active don't pay their domain renewal fees, or don't host a webpage behind it."
