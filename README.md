# CleanHunt

Have you ever searched something on ProductHunt and faced difficulty while perusing, due to all the dead products? Introducing CleanHunt, a product which uses the existing ProductHunt API and discards those products from the results which don't have a live landing page. While not a perfect method to check for dead products, all startups which are no longer active don't pay their domain renewal fees, or don't host a webpage behind it. This is what we try to look for.

Uses the Algolia ProductHunt API for search.
